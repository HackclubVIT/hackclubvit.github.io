## Rules

- Use relative units in CSS, **not absolute**.
- Use .webp format for images
- Make the webpage **responsive**.
- Inspect the page to check for multiple devices and then apply for PR.
- Use `kebab-case` for css class/id names and `camelCase` for js variables.
- Add separate CSS files in `CSS/` folder to avoid mixing of CSS of different sections.
